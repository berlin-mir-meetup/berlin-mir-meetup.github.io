### 2017-04-24: Harmonic Mixing & Rhythmic Similarity

Monday, April 24, 2017

7:30 PM, hosted by [Audio Communication Group of TU Berlin](http://www.ak.tu-berlin.de/menue/fachgebiet_audiokommunikation/parameter/en/)

[Marchstraße 8, 10587 Berlin, Berlin](https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&q=Marchstra%C3%9Fe+8%2C+10587+Berlin%2C+Berlin%2C+de) - [lab](http://www.hybrid-plattform.org/ueber-uns/hybrid-lab/)

For the second edition of the Music Information Retrieval meetup, the
Audio Communication Group of TU Berlin is hosting us in the
HybridLab.

#### Roman Gebhardt: Psychoacoustic Approaches to Harmonic Mixing

Roman Gebhardt (TU Berlin) will give a talk on his works on harmonic
analysis of music based on psychoacoustic principles. He will present
a system for automatic harmonic adjustment of two or more pieces of
music that builds upon the theory of roughness. As a counterpart to
well-known beat synchronization, this motivates synchronization for
music mixing in the spectral domain to maximize the musical consonance
of a mix. He will as well give insight into a perceptually based
filtering process for chroma-analysis of musical audio that has proven
successful in key detection tasks and outline the idea of an extension
of classic key detection to root notes.

#### Nico Lehrbach: Measuring Rhythmic Similarity of Music Excerpts

Nico Lehrbach (TU Berlin) will present his work investigating the
rhythmic similarity estimation of short music excerpts. Rhythmic
similarity is seen as one component of general music
similarity. Derived from existing measures of music similarity like
the Rhythmic Patterns and the Onset Patterns, he presents a new
approach, the Bar Patterns. A survey was carried out in order to gain
a quantitative, empirical ground truth of the rhythmic similarity of
short music excerpts presented to the participants. These empirical
data indicate the general possibility of measuring rhythmic similarity
and is taken as a base to compare the algorithmic approaches.


### 2017-03-20: Kick-off with Meinard Müller

Monday, March 20, 2017

7:30 PM, hosted by [SoundCloud](http://soundcloud.com/)

[Rheinsberger Str. 76/77 10115, Berlin](https://www.google.de/maps/place/Rheinsberger+Str.+76,+10115+Berlin/@52.53684,13.3927413,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x47a851f11cea3617:0xf49c66be6f06d7c0!8m2!3d52.53684!4d13.39493?hl=en) -
Reception is on the second floor of the factory building

We are very pleased to have
[Meinard Müller](https://www.audiolabs-erlangen.de/fau/professor/mueller)
from the International AudioLabs Erlangen as our first speaker for the
MIR meetup. He will give an overview of the current state-of-the-art
in Music Information Retrieval and an outlook on future directions and
research problems. After the talk, there will be the opportunity for
personal conversations with him and some members of his research group
as well as representatives from various Berlin/Potsdam based
university groups and companies working on MIR.

#### Speaker

Meinard Müller is professor for Semantic Audio Processing at the
International Audio Laboratories Erlangen, Germany, a joint
institution of the Friedrich-Alexander-Universität
Erlangen-Nürnberg (FAU) and the Fraunhofer Institute for
Integrated Circuits IIS. His research interests include music
processing, music information retrieval, audio signal processing,
content-based multimedia, and motion retrieval.
